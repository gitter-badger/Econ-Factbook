## Econ Factbook

This is the official of the project Econ Factbook, created by
[Alex Peek](https://github.com/orgs/okfn-oe/people/mcnabber091), which is a visual representation of the many datasets that soon will be published online.

## Contributing

To contribute to the project, feel free to clone this repository and alter the python scripts under `/python-scripts-to-fetch-data`. `/econfactbook.org` page is dedicated to the things that will be published online in the [website](http://econfactbook.org/).

### Languages and technicalities
The website will later be published using Javascript for simplicity of service integrations, whilst the code to fetch and prepare the many datasets will be done in Python. Check the issues tab for bugs you may want to squat.

### Converting data to datapackage

If there is any dataset missing (look at the issues tab), please visit [this repository](https://github.com/okfn-oe/datapackage-validator) and feel free to convert all those missing data bits into datasets.

## Contribution to Open Economics
This project is one of the most important ones from [Open Economics](https://openeconomics.net), as a response to the group's goals and mission: To Act as a central point of reference and support for those interested in open economic data.
